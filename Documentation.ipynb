    "* $P_{current}$: Current points accumulated by the team.\n",
    "* $M_{played}$: Number of matches already played.\n",
    "* $M_{total}$: Total league matches (14 for IPL).\n",
    "* $M_{rem}$: Matches remaining ($M_{total} - M_{played}$).\n",
    "* $C_{rem}$: Points capacity remaining ($2 \\times M_{rem}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Progress Weight (The \"Stage\" Factor)\n",
    "This factor scales the importance based on how late it is in the season. A match in the final week carries more \"clutch\" weight than a match in the first week.\n",
    "$$W_{progress} = 0.5 + \\left( 0.5 \\times \\frac{M_{played}}{M_{total}} \\right)$$\n",

    "# Pressure Performance Score (PPS) Formulation \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Pressure Performance Score (PPS)** is a specialized metric designed to measure a player's effectiveness under high-stakes conditions. It operationalizes the relationship between raw output and three layers of situational stress: **Contextual** (Match Importance), **Positional** (Entry Point), and **Professional** (Expectation Level).\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation for each match is governed by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$PPS_{Match} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Performance Output} \\times \\text{Entry Point Stress} \\times \\text{Stage Magnitude}}{\\text{Level Resistance Factor}} \\right)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Performance Output (The Base Impact)**\n",
    "This measures the raw contribution of the player in the match, standardized across roles:\n",
    "* **For Batters:** $Runs \\times (Strike Rate / 100)$\n",
    "* **For Bowlers:** $(Wickets \\times 25) + Dots$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Entry Point Stress (The \"Crisis\" Factor)**\n",
    "This captures **when** the player began their task. It identifies \"collapse rescuers\" by comparing the state of the innings to the time remaining:\n",
    "* **Formula:** $\\frac{Fall \\ of \\ Wicket + 1}{Over \\ of \\ wicket + 1}$\n",
    "* **Logic:** High values (e.g., entering at 15/3 in Over 2) significantly multiply the score. Low values (e.g., entering at 180/3 in Over 19) result in a lower multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Stage Magnitude (The \"Big Stage\" Factor)**\n",
    "Utilizes the pre-calculated numerical importance values from the `league.csv` file for the specific team.\n",
    "* **Formula:** $e^{(Importance_{Team} / 5)}$\n",
    "* **Logic:** The exponential $e$ ensures that high-stakes matches (Playoffs/Finals) carry exponentially more weight than standard league games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Level Resistance Factor (The \"Expectation\" Filter)**\n",
    "This adjusts the score based on the player's status in `player_details.csv`. Higher status players have a higher \"resistance\" because they are expected to handle pressure as a baseline.\n",
    "* **Uncapped:** Assigned **0.5** (Doubles the score to reward breakthrough performances).\n",
    "* **Capped:** Assigned **1.0** (Standard international expectation).\n",
    "* **Elite:** Assigned **1.5** (Highest resistance; elite players must produce massive impact to move their score significantly).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Historical Reputation (EMA)**\n",
    "To ensure the score reflects long-term reliability, an **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** is applied across all previous match data. This weights recent \"clutch\" performances more heavily while preserving a player’s big-game reputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Professional Selection Baseline & Sigmoid Scaling**\n",
    "Because all 247+ players are professionals, the model assumes a **Baseline of 30** (representing the standard pressure-handling capability required to be selected for a squad). The remaining 70 points are distributed via a Sigmoid function based on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Formula:** $30 + \\left( \\frac{70}{1 + e^{-Z}} \\right)$\n",
    "* **Result:** * **30 Points:** The \"Selection Floor\" for any player in the roster with no match data or 0 impact.\n",
    "    * **50-60 Points:** Average professional performance under pressure.\n",
    "    * **90+ Points:** Elite \"Clutch\" performers who consistently win high-importance matches."
